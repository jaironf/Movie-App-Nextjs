# Movie App Project

A React-based movie app that allows users to view movie details, including title, description, release date, popularity, and an image. The project uses Next.js, NextUI, and React to deliver an interactive and dynamic UI.

## Features

- **Movie List**: Display a list of movies fetched from an API.
- **Movie Modal**: View detailed information about a specific movie, including title, description, release date, popularity, and an image.
- **Modal with Backdrop**: The modal includes a blurred backdrop when opened for better focus on the content.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building the user interface.
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering, routing, and API calls.
- **NextUI**: UI component library to create modern, customizable components (like buttons, modals, etc.).
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe programming language for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For custom styling and responsiveness.

## Setup Instructions

    ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
    Start the development server using the following command:
